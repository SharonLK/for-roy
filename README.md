Book a Seat offers a solution to the ever lasting problem of managing seats in the library. This project's main goal is to combat situations where students leave their seat occupied by bags or notebooks for hours while attending a lecture or having lunch, disallowing others to have this seat. This is done using high-end newly developed indoor positioning systems that allow the application to know when the student has left the library, and free the seat accordingly.
